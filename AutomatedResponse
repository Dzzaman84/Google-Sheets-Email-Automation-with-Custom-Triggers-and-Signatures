// Description:
// This script automatically sends an email when specific trigger words are entered in Column D of a Google Sheet.
// The recipient's email is taken from Column A of the same row. The message content is predefined based on the trigger word.
//
// How It Works:
// 1. When a user enters "Are you there", "Bye", or "Hello" in Column D, the script fetches the email from Column A.
// 2. It checks if the trigger word matches a predefined message.
// 3. If a match is found, it sends an automated email to the recipient.
//
// Tips for Editing:
// - To add more trigger words, update the 'messages' object with new key-value pairs.
// - To change the subject of the email, edit the "Automated Response" text in the sendEmail function.
// - To modify the sender name, update the 'name' field in MailApp.sendEmail.
// - Ensure the Google Sheets trigger is set to "onEdit" for the script to function properly.

function onEdit(e) {
  var sheet = e.source.getActiveSheet();
  var range = e.range;
  var column = range.getColumn();
  var row = range.getRow();

  if (column === 4) { // Check if edit is in Column D (4th column)
    var email = sheet.getRange(row, 1).getValue(); // Get email from Column A
    var triggerWord = range.getValue();
    
    var messages = {
      "Are you there": "Hello! Just checking in. Let me know if you need anything.",
      "Bye": "Goodbye! Have a great day!",
      "Hello": "Hi there! Hope you're doing well."
    };
    
    if (messages[triggerWord]) {
      sendEmail(email, "Automated Response", messages[triggerWord]);
    }
  }
}

function sendEmail(recipient, subject, body) {
  MailApp.sendEmail({
    to: recipient,
    subject: subject,
    body: body,
    name: "Automated System"
  });
}
